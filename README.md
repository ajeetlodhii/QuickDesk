🛠️ Key Functionalities
We've built QuickDesk with powerful but easy-to-use features to make your workflow effortless.

Notifications and Communication
Email Notifications: Never miss an important update. The system automatically sends an email notification when a new ticket is created or a ticket's status changes.

Threaded Conversations: All replies and updates are displayed in a clear, easy-to-follow timeline directly on the ticket, so the entire history is always in one place.

Upvoting & Downvoting: Users can provide feedback on solutions by upvoting or downvoting questions, helping to highlight the most helpful responses.

Dashboard and Navigation

Advanced Search & Filtering: Quickly find the tickets you need. You can filter by:

Ticket status (Open/Closed)

Category

"My Tickets Only" view

Smart Sorting: Sort tickets based on what's most urgent or relevant:

Most Replied Tickets

Recently Modified

🚶 Basic Workflow: A Ticket's Journey
Wondering how a ticket moves through the system? It's a simple, six-step process:

Ticket Creation: A user logs in and submits a new ticket with details, a category, and an optional attachment. The ticket status starts as Open.

Agent Assignment: A support agent views the new ticket on their dashboard and picks it up, changing the status to In Progress.

Communication: The agent works on the issue and provides updates by adding replies. The user receives email notifications and can reply as needed.

Resolution: The agent resolves the issue and marks the ticket as Resolved.

Closure: The user is satisfied with the resolution and confirms the ticket can be Closed.
